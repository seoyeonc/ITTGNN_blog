<p><strong>EMHIRES Wind 풍력</strong></p>
<p>The first version of EMHIRES dataset releases four different files about the wind power generation hourly time series during 30 years (1986-2015), taking into account the existing wind fleet at the end of 2015, for each country (onshore and offshore), bidding zone and by NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 region. The time series are given as capacity factors. The installed capacity used accounted for calculating the capacity factors are summarised in the annexes of the report.</p>
<p>https://setis.ec.europa.eu/emhires-dataset-part-i-wind-power-generation_en</p>
<p>EMHIRES 데이터셋의 첫 번째 버전은 30년(1986-2015) 동안의 시간별 풍력 발전 시계열에 관한 네 가지 파일을 제공합니다. 이 데이터는 2015년 말 기준으로 각 국가(육상 및 해상), 입찰 구역, 그리고 NUTS 1 및 NUTS 2 지역별로 풍력 발전 용량 계수를 고려하여 작성되었습니다. 시계열 데이터는 용량 계수로 제공되며, 사용된 설치 용량에 대한 정보는 보고서 부록에 요약되어 있습니다.</p>
<p>EMHIRES 풍력 발전 시계열 데이터는 ENTSO-E 연간 생산 통계에 따라 표준화</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><p>EMHIRES는 EU-28, 노르웨이, 스위스, 그리고 서발칸 비EU 국가들의 재생 가능 전력(RES-E) 생성 시간 시리즈를 제공합니다.</p></li>
<li><p>이 시간 시리즈는 시간별 단위로 제공되며, 다양한 집계 수준에서 제공됩니다. 구체적으로는 국가별(온쇼어와 오프쇼어), 전력 시장 입찰 구역(bidding zone), 그리고 유로스타트(EUROSTAT)에서 정의한 유럽의 통계적 지역 단위(NUTS)에 따라 제공됩니다.</p></li>
<li><p>특히, NUTS 1 및 NUTS 2 수준으로 제공됩니다.</p></li>
<li><p>시간 시리즈 집계 수준:</p>
<ul>
<li>국가별(온쇼어 및 오프쇼어 풍력 발전 포함)</li>
<li>전력 시장 입찰 구역별(bidding zone)</li>
<li>NUTS 1 및 NUTS 2 수준으로 세분화된 데이터</li>
<li>전력 시장 구역 (Bidding Zones):</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>정치적/영토적 경계와 다른 구역: 전력 시장 현실을 반영하기 위해, 정치적 또는 영토적 경계와는 다른 구역으로 데이터가 제공됩니다. 예를 들어, 아일랜드에서는 공화국과 북아일랜드가 하나의 시장 구역으로 묶여 있습니다.</p></li>
<li><p>특별한 구역 설정: 노르웨이, 스웨덴, 덴마크, 이탈리아 등에서는 풍력 발전소가 설치된 지역에 대해 각기 다른 시장 구역을 세분화하여 제공합니다. 예를 들어, 이탈리아는 6개 구역으로 나뉩니다.</p></li>
<li><p>그리스의 경우: 그리스에서는 연결된 구역에 대해서만 시간 시리즈가 제공됩니다. 즉, 섬 지역에 있는 풍력 발전소는 본토 전력 시스템에 연결되지 않으므로 제외됩니다.</p></li>
